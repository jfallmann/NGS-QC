  * What depth saturated binding?
      * ChIP
          * sampling -> compare peaks
              *  does # of peaks change of only peak height?
                  *  # of peaks bad, peak heigth ok, as less signal was used
      *  RNA-Seq
          *  most stable as no manipulation like crosslinking or IP neccessary
      *  IP-based methods
          *  stability of peaks strongly depending on target

  *  How to get a hint if quality of samples is ok?
